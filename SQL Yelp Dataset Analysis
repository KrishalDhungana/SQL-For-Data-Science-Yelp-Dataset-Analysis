Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours = 10000
iii. Category = 10000
iv. Attribute = 10000
v. Review = 10000
vi. Checkin = 10000
vii. Photo = 10000
viii. Tip = 10000 (user_id)
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = 10000
xi. Elite_years = 10000

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer:
	No
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	select * from user where id is null or name is null or  review_count is null or  yelping_since is null or  useful is null or  funny is null or  cool is null or  fans is null or  average_stars is null or compliment_hot is null or compliment_more is null or  compliment_profile is null or  compliment_list is null or  compliment_note is null or  compliment_plain is null or  compliment_cool is null or  compliment_funny is null or  compliment_writer is null or  compliment_photos is null;

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1	max:	5	avg: 3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	Code: select name, review_count, fans from user order by review_count desc;
	Result: there does not seem to be a clear positive correlation between the number of reviews and fans.
	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer:
+------------------------+----------+-------------------+
| id                     | wordFind | count("wordFind") |
+------------------------+----------+-------------------+
| -7rRwqvm4TGjAcVdvmrskA | NA       |              8042 |
| -7qMOxcUQTVHOn4AGS8DVg | hate     |               178 |
| -7RNX0zY4T6OZryYXhxbHA | love     |              1780 |
+------------------------+----------+-------------------+
Thus, there are more reviews with the word “love”
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
SELECT id,
CASE
WHEN text LIKE '%love%' THEN 'love'
WHEN text LIKE '%hate%' THEN 'hate'
ELSE 'NA'
END AS wordFind,
count("wordFind")
FROM review
GROUP BY (wordFind)

	
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	SELECT name, fans from user order by fans desc;

	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
+-----------+------+

+-----------+------+
| Amy       |  503 |
| Mimi      |  497 |
| Harald    |  311 |

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

Yes, the businesses in Las Vegas that stayed open longer seemed to have lower stars. 

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

Not quite. With regard to businesses at the far end of the spectrum (extremely low-rated or extremely high-rated), they did not have a high number of reviews. The bulk of reviews came around the middle, for businesses rated between 3.0 and 4.0. 
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

In general, the reviews for any business in Las Vegas dipped no lower than 2.5, so the overall city ratings are fairly high. 

SQL code used for analysis:

	SELECT name, city, stars, review_count, hours 
FROM business
INNER JOIN hours ON business.id = hours.business_id
WHERE city = "Las Vegas"
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY stars ASC;
	
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1: Businesses that are still open had a higher average star rating
         
         
ii. Difference 2: Businesses that are still open had a higher average review count
         
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT avg(stars), avg(review_count), is_open 
FROM business
GROUP BY is_open;
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

Are there any differences in the review count or average star rating for US businesses compared to Canadian businesses? 
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

I will need data from the business dataset. The columns of interest include name, state, stars, and review_count. For obvious reasons, stars, and review_count are crucial for analysis. I will create a new column comprised of CAN or AME to identify whether a business is Canadian or American by analyzing its state value (whether it is a Canadian province or not. Canadian province abbreviations include NL, PE, NS, NB, QC, ON, MB, SK, AB, BC, YT, NT, NU. In the dataset, the only Canadian provinces that show up are QC (Quebec) and Ontario (ON). From there, I will find the average star rating and review count. 
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
         
+---------------+-------------------+---------+
|    avg(stars) | avg(review_count) | Country |
+---------------+-------------------+---------+
| 3.69590903316 |     32.7086774235 | AME     |
|  3.5032879286 |     22.1282292156 | CAN     |
+---------------+-------------------+---------+
As you can see, American businesses actually averaged more reviews and a higher star rating.
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:
SELECT avg(stars), avg(review_count),
CASE 
WHEN state = "ON" THEN "CAN"
WHEN state = "QC" THEN "CAN"
ELSE "AME"
END AS Country
FROM business
GROUP BY Country;
